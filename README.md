massivepy
=========

this module contains useful file parsers for [Massive](http://www.massivesoftware.com).  this is the third iteration of the code.  i have a forth iteration in mind but really can't be bothered to implement it at this point.  this involves using a stack to manage the nested blocks.  maybe when i get to adding massive 5 support.  or not...

currently .mas, .cdl, .rib files can be parsed.  not everything is supported, you'll have to look through the code to figure out how to use it.  if you can't figure it out, well, gimme a shout and maybe you can convince me to write some examples and docs.
